# Hydroxylapatit-Modell

#The modell is applicable in a CaCO3-H20-CO2 system in soil. It can  predict the concentration of Phosphor in solution, in the equilibrium with Hydroxylapatit and Brushite. Parameters are temperature, CO2-partial pressure and Ca2-concentration.

#The project includes three R-files:

#1.functions (with the CaCO3-H2O-CO2 modell and a function to predict the P-conentration)

#2.P_mesure_mod (example data (csv.) and some plots)

#3.dissociation_of_ophos (function to predict the pH-value with the  CaCO3-H20-CO2 system as base information, and some example plots)
