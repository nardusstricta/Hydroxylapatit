# Hydroxylapatit-Modell

#The modell is applicable in a CaCO3-H20-CO2 System in soil. It can  predict the concentration of Phosphor in solution, in the equilibrium with Hydroxylapatit and Brushite. Parameters are Temperatur, CO2-Partial pressure and Ca2-concentration.

#The Project includes three R-files:

#1.functions (with the CaCO3-H20-CO2 Modell and the Function to predict the P-conentration)

#2.P_mesure_mod (example data and some plots)

#3.dissociation_of_ophos (Function to predict the pH-value with the  CaCO3-H20-CO2 System as base, and some example plots)
